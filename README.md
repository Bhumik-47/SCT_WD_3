# 🎮 Task 03: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

## Project Description

This is an interactive implementation of the classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project focuses heavily on complex game logic, state management, and event handling within a browser environment.

## Key Features

* **Two-Player Mode:** Players take alternating turns (X and O) by clicking on the board cells.
* **Game State Management:** The state of the 3x3 board is tracked efficiently using a JavaScript array, allowing for quick checks against winning conditions.
* **Winning Logic:** Comprehensive logic checks all eight possible winning conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals) after every move.
* **Visual Feedback:** The status display guides the players by announcing the current player's turn, the winner, or a draw. Winning cells are visually highlighted (green background) when the game concludes.
* **Restart Functionality:** A single button resets the entire game state, clears the board, and prepares for a new round.
